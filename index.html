            <p>Digitalization is a phenomenon that has become increasingly prominent over the years
                as countries seek to adapt to the changing world and improve the standards of living of their citizens.
                Singapore, an island state in southeast Asia, has not been spared from this digital wave, and it
                has developed plans to facilitate digitalization from as early as the 1980s.
                Although digitalization is often quoted as a boon to many, there remain those who have not been recipients of its bounty 
                sociodigital divides are surfacing between generations with vulnerable older adults
                increasingly being unable to keep up with such rapid digital progress.</p>
